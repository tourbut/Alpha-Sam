# DevOps Work Log - 2026-01-11

## Tasks Completed

1.  **Migration Strategy Planning**:
    - Analyzed the v1.2.0 migration script (`alembic/versions/b5eb91a2b993_add_portfolio_and_refactor_position_.py`).
    - The script includes data migration logic (INSERT/UPDATE), which is critical.
    - Established strict **Backup-First** policy before execution.
    - Created detailed **Deployment & Migration Checklist** (`.artifacts/projects/deployment_checklist_v1.2.0.md`).

2.  **Rollback Strategy**:
    - Defined a two-tier rollback plan:
        1.  `alembic downgrade` for schema-only failures.
        2.  **Full DB Restore** for data corruption during migration (recommended due to the destructive nature of the data move).

## Notes
- The migration locks tables while updating `positions` and `transactions`. Expect brief downtime or high latency. Maintenance window is recommended.
