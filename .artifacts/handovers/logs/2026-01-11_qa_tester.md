## Tasks Completed

1.  **Dashboard Bug Verification**:
    - Verified `GET /api/v1/portfolios/` endpoint.
    - Confirmed it returns 200 OK, indicating the "double prefix" routing issue is resolved.

2.  **v1.2.0 Feature Verification (API Level)**:
    - **Portfolios**: Verified creation and listing of multiple portfolios.
    - **Transactions**: Verified "BUY" and "SELL" transaction creation.
    - **Positions**: Verified automatic position calculation and updates based on transactions.
        - BUY 10 -> Qty 10
        - SELL 5 -> Qty 5 (Avg price maintained)

3.  **Bug Fix (Schema Mismatch)**:
    - Encountered 500 Error on Position API.
    - Diagnosed mismatch between `PositionRead` schema (legacy `buy_price`) and `Position` model (new `avg_price`).

    - Verified fix.
